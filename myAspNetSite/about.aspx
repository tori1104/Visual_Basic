        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my ever growing page as a web developer. I&rsquo;m currently working on the Dynamic Web program at Sullivan College of Technology and Design. I started off my life working towards being a nurse and earn my LPN and working with intellectually disabled young adults. However after a few years of working in the healthcare industry, I found a new passion.  Now I&rsquo;m on a life high enjoying the learning curbs of web design and coding at Sullivan. I couldn&rsquo;t be any happier!</p>
            <p>My life goal is to finish my degree and building a strong resume and portfolio for my future. I also wish to make a name and label for myself as I work on freelance material to help small business grow in the community.</p>
